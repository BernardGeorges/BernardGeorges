#### A little About Me
 I have a passion for Machine Learning (ML), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Full-Stack Development, and Robotics. I‚Äôm driven by the challenge of solving complex problems, new adventures and above all way to improve and better myself.

Outside of coding, I‚Äôm passionate about traveling, socializing, and engaging in sports. Whether it‚Äôs exploring new cultures or enjoying a friendly game, I value the balance between my professional and personal life.

I‚Äôm constantly learning and staying up-to-date with the latest trends in generative AI, MLOps, and cloud-native technologies like AWS and Azure. I'm always looking for opportunities to contribute to exciting projects and grow as both a developer and a person. Feel free to reach out if you‚Äôre interested in collaborating or just want to chat about tech, travel, or sports!

My github is mainly for college projects and side-projects. Hope you find something useful.
